if you answered "No" to most of the questions, this workshop may be too advanced for you, 
and you may want to consider unregistering from this workshop and signing up in the future, when you have the prerequired knowledge. 
You could consider following a [data carpentry workshop](https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/) to learn about data preprocessing 
and/or learn more about machine learning in this course. Check  our upcoming workshops [here](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/events/?f=workshops). 
Please contact training@esciencecenter.nl if you have any questions about the prerequisites or course content.

Note that this workshop is an introduction into deep learning. 
If you are already familiar with the concepts in the syllabus 
then a more advanced course might be better suited for your interests!
