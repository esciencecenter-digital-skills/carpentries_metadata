This workshop gives an introduction to deep learning for researchers who are familiar with the basics of (non-deep) machine learning.
Participants will learn how to prepare data for deep learning, how to implement a basic Deep Learning model in Python with Keras, how to monitor and troubleshoot the training process and how to implement different layer types, such as convolutional layers.
