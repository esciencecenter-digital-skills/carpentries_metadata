### Requirements

- A programming editor, when in doubt we recommend [Microsoft VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Python version 3.9, we recommend [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or
  [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) if you only use the command-line
interface. If you insist on using vanilla Python, see instructions below.
- Git. If you're on Windows, follow these instructions: [Git for Windows](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#shell).
- Graphviz. Follow these instructions: [Installing Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/)

To follow along with the workshop, you need to prepare an environment. Clone the workshop repository
that we prepared:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/parallel-python-workshop.git
cd parallel-python-workshop
```

You may prepare the environment either in `conda` or using vanilla Python with `poetry`.

#### Conda (recommended)
For most users we recommend that you use `conda` to install the requirements for the workshop.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate parallel-python
pytest
```

If the tests pass, you're all good! Otherwise, please contact us before the workshop.

#### Poetry
Only follow these instructions if you're on Linux or Mac and don't have `conda` installed. Make sure
that you have Python 3.9 installed.

If you've never used `poetry` before, [check it out!](https://python-poetry.org/)

```bash
pip install --user poetry
poetry install
poetry run pytest
```
