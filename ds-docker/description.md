This workshop aims to get you familiar with containerization using docker in order to make your 
work more reproducible.

Participants will start off by learning the principles of containerization and interacting with 
existing docker containers. After that, they will be taught to create their own docker images. 
The workshop will end with some examples for using docker in an academic environment.
