This workshop aims to introduce the use of Docker containers (and similar technology). Containers
can help to make you work more reproducible. Your work becomes instantly accessible to potential
users *without* going through pages of install instructions or days of compiling decade old Fortran
programs. Your work can continue to be accessible in the coming years.

### What are Software Containers? 
Containers allow a researcher to package up a project with all of the parts it needs - such as libraries, dependencies, and system settings - and ship it all out as one package. Anyone can then open up a container and work within it, viewing and interacting with the project as if the machine they are accessing it from is identical to the machine specified in the container - regardless of what their computational environment actually is. They are designed to make it easier to transfer projects between very different environments. 

Containers are a particularly useful way for reproducing research which relies on software to be configured in a certain way, or which makes use of libraries that vary between (or do not exist on) different systems. In summary, **containers are a more robust way of sharing reproducible research**.
