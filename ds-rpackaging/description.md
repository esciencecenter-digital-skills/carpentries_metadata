This workshop will help you make your research reproducible, by taking your script and turning it into a shareable R package.

R packages are no more and no less than a standard way of structuring your work. The standardization makes packages easily installable and shareable, and allows others to reuse your code in a painless way, making your research more reproducible.

But by turning your script into a package you achieve more than reusability: in doing so, you become a better programmer. In the structure of a package, best software development practices are implemented. You will learn to write tests and documentation, and help your users get started with a vignette. At the end of this workshop, we aim to have made your code more robust, and your experience more enjoyable.
