Chances are that you have used R packages before, but did you know you can write your own? Wrapping your code and data into a package helps you create a more robust, more reproducible and more enjoyable research coding experience. During our R Packaging workshop, you will take a scripted project (your own, preferably!) and build your own R Package. While building this package, you will create tests to ensure your code works (no more manual checks!), write clear documentation, and learn how to share it with others.
