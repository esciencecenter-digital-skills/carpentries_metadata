This hands-on workshop will provide you with the basics of machine learning using Python.

Machine learning is the field devoted to methods and algorithms that 'learn' from data. 
It can be applied to a vast range of different domains, from linguistics to physics and from medical imaging to history.

This introduction aims to cover the basics of machine learning in a practical and hands-on manner, 
so that upon completion, you will be able to train your first machine learning models and understand what next steps to take to improve the them.
