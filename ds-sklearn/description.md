This hands-on workshop will provide you with the basics of machine learning using Python.

Machine learning is the field devoted to methods and algorithms that 'learn' from data.
It can be applied to a vast range of different domains, from linguistics to physics and from medical imaging to history.

This workshop covers the basics of machine learning in a practical and hands-on manner,
so that upon completion, you will be able to train your first machine learning models and understand what next steps to take to improve them.

We start with data exploration and prepare the data so that it is suitable for machine learning.
Then we learn how to train a model on the data using scikit-learn.
We learn how to select the best model from the trained models and how to
use different machine learning models (like linear regression, logistic regression,
and decision tree models).
Finally, we discuss some of the best practices when starting your own machine learning project.
