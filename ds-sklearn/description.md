This hands-on workshop will provide you with the basics of machine learning using Python.

Machine learning is the field devoted to methods and algorithms that 'learn' from data. 
It can be applied to a vast range of different domains, from linguistics to physics and from medical imaging to history.

This workshop aims to cover the basics of machine learning in a practical and hands-on manner, 
so that upon completion, you will be able to train your first machine learning models and understand what next steps to take to improve them.

We start with processing the data so that it is suitable for machine learning.
Then we learn how to fit a model to the data using scikit-learn.
We learn how to select the best model, learn about different machine learning models,
and discuss some of the best practices when starting your own machine learning project.
