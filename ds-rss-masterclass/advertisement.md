Research software is a topic of growing interest for many researchers, many of them write code on a regular basis. While supporting researchers, you can expect more and more software related questions regarding software management plans (SMPs) or how to publish software. As you are probably not developing software (full-time) yourself, this masterclass may be a good opportunity for you to improve and test your knowledge around basic concepts of research software and help you to feel more ready for software related questions in the future. Split over two separate days, with homework exercises in between, this masterclass will teach you everything you need to know to support researchers with their questions about managing their research software. No programming skills required!
