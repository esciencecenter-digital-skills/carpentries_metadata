Research software is a topic of growing interest for many researchers. This masterclass is tailored for support staff who are already familiar with Research Data Management and the FAIR principles but would like to learn more about how to manage software better and help researchers manage their research software/code. 

The masterclass will cover the following key aspects:

- How is software being developed? What is research software and how much do I need to know?
- What are Software Management Plans (SMPs) and how can researchers benefit from them? How can I help researchers to fill in SMPs?
- What is FAIR software, and what do I need to know to support researchers?
- What software licenses exist, why are they important and how do I help researchers pick the right one?
- Why is software publication and citation important? How should software be published and cited?
- Why is it important to adopt good software development practices?
- The masterclass will cover hands-on exercises and many opportunities to ask questions that are relevant to you, your experience, and your field. 

The masterclass is split over two separate days with homework exercises in between.
