You will also need to install the following packages:

In addition, we recommend an account on GitHub. [Create one here](https://github.com/signup).
If you clone the [image-processing repository](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/image-processing) at esciencecenter-digital-skills, then you will have all the data for the class already.
