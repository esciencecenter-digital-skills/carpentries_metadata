The key objective of this workshop is to grow researchers' software skills necessary
to apply good practices that enable open and reproducible research.
The workshop focuses on building modular, reusable, maintainable, sustainable, reproducible,
testable, and robust software. This will allow you to more easily organize, maintain and share your data. 
The participants should be familiar with programming and regularly write code for their research, 
but no extensive expertise or knowledge of specific tools are required.

This workshop is inspired by and based on [CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/)
training materials.
