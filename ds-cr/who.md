It is assumed that participants already write code for their research, but no expertise is required. Some experience in navigating file trees and editing files in a terminal session, as well as basic knowledge of Python programming is recommended.

If you find the topics that are covered in this workshop too basic, you could consider joining the 'Intermediate Research Software Development' workshop. That workshop has a similar focus, but also teaches more intermediate topics like software architecture, object-oriented & functional programming, Integrated Software Development environments and is targeted to slightly more advanced research software engineers.
