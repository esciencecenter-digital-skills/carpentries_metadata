The key objective of a this workshop is to grow researchersâ€™ software best practices skills to facilitate open and reproducible research. The workshops focus on methods to build modular, reusable, maintainable, sustainable, reproducible, testable, and robust software. It is assumed that participants already write code for their research, but no expertise is required.

**Optional Introduction to Git on day 1**. From practice, we know the level of experience with git varies a lot. Therefore we offer an optional 'Introduction to version control with Git' lesson on day 1 of the workshop. Please take [this 1-minute Quiz](https://forms.office.com/r/p7Lc4t3W8x) to quickly self-assess your git knowledge. **If you answered all questions correctly you can join the workshop from day 2 onwards. Otherwise, you should join the "Introduction to Git" session on day one.**
