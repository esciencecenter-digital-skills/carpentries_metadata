This workshop teaches the basics of how to deal with large online datasets in astronomy. You will learn how to use ADQL (a dialect of SQL) to talk to these databases, work with modern data standards, perform coordinate transformations and create publication quality visualizations, all from the comfort of a Python interface. In the process we reproduce the discovery of a tidal stream in the Milkyway using the latest Gaia and Pan-STARSS datasets.
