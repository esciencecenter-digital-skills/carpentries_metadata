## Requirements

### Programming environment

We will teach GPU programming using the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), a programming environment that runs in a web browser.
For this to work you will need a reasonably up-to-date browser.
The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and Firefox browsers are all [supported](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#browser-compatibility) (some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9 and below, are not).

In particular, for this workshop we are using the infrastructure of [JupyterHub for Education](https://servicedesk.surfsara.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/JupyterHub+for+education) provided by [SURF](https://www.surf.nl/), or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) as an alternative.
