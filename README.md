A place to gather metadata (audience, prerequisites, workshop descriptions) for
carpentries workshops taught at the Netherlands eScience Center. The metadata are
used for creating a workshop page with
[esciencecenter-digital-skills/next-workshop-template](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/next-workshop-template).
See
[documentation](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/next-workshop-template#required-information-and-customizing-your-workshop-page).

The folder "next-lesson" is a template. Copy the folder and rename it to the
curriculum name e.g. "ds-parallel". Then eidt the files:

-    advertisement.md: text that will be used to advertise the workshop (eg. email)
-    description.md: description on the lesson page, workshop page and eventbrite page
