# Workshop metadata

A place to gather metadata (audience, prerequisites, workshop descriptions) for
carpentries workshops taught at the Netherlands eScience Center. The metadata are
used for creating a workshop page with
[esciencecenter-digital-skills/workshop-template](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/workshop-template).
See
