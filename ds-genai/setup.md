## Setting up Codeium ##

1. Make sure you have an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) installed on your computer. Go to [the Codeium download page](https://codeium.com/download) to see a list of supported IDEs and installation instructions. In the current lesson, we will be working in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), therefore, we recommend installing VS Code. You can download it from the [VS Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

2. You can follow the [Codeium installation instructions in VS Code](https://codeium.com/vscode_tutorial) on the official website.

3. Open Extension Marketplace: Open the Extension Marketplace, which is the icon with boxes on the primary sidebar in your VS Code.

4. Install Codeium: Type Codeium in the marketplace search bar, open up the page and click the blue Install button.

5. Authorize: After installation is complete, you should be prompted by Visual Studio Code with a pop-up on the bottom right to authorize Codeium. 
*If not, you should see an option to sign in to your Codeium account in the bottom left Accounts tab of your Visual Studio Code window.* 
Click the Sign in with Auth to use Codeium option. Either method (popup or Accounts tab) should redirect you to the Codeium website.

1. Create Account: If you do not have a Codeium account yet, you will be redirected to create an account.

2. Sign In: If you are not signed in, please sign in with your account details. Once you sign in, you will be redirected back to Visual Studio Code via pop-up.
Click Open Visual Studio Code, which should redirect you back to Visual Studio Code.
*If you are using a browser-based IDE, instead of being redirected back with pop-up, you will be routed to instructions on how to complete authentication by providing an access token. Please follow these instructions instead of Step 6, and then continue on with "Using Codeium."*

1. All Done! You will be asked to confirm the authentication in Visual Studio Code (click Open in the resulting pop-up).
