### Computer

Participants must work on a computer with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) on which they have administrative privileges. 

### Software

To participate in this workshop, you will need to prepare the following (if you haven't already):
- Install Shell and Git. Please refer to [this page](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/git-in-terminal/#installation) for installation instructions.
- Create a GitHub account. Please refer to [this page](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/github/) for instructions.
- Set up an SSH connection to GitHub. Please refer to [this page](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/ssh/) for instructions.

### To confirm that everything works

You should now be able to open [a terminal window](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/#open-a-new-shell) and execute the following commands:

#### Git
```
git --version
```
returning (something similar to):
```
git version 2.37.1 (Apple Git-137.1)
```

#### Github account & SSH connection 
```
ssh git@github.com
```
returning (something similar to):
```
Hi [username]! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
Connection to github.com closed.
```

#### If something does not work:
Follow the corresponding setup instructions. If you still need help, send us an email at training@esciencecenter.nl.
